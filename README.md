# @crossly/buyer-cli

Your Crossly shopping, from the terminal.

> **Not on npm yet.** `@crossly/buyer-cli` is unreleased — the install command below
> will 404 until the first publish. To try it now, clone this repo and build from
> source. Star or watch to hear when it lands.

```bash
npm i -g @crossly/buyer-cli
crossly-buyer login --token crossly_oat_...
crossly-buyer cart get
```

## Two binaries, because two APIs

| | |
|---|---|
| `crossly` ([@crossly/cli](https://github.com/crossly-dev/crossly-cli)) | a seller's **store** — 287 commands |
| `crossly-buyer` (this) | a person's **own shopping** — 15 commands |

Different credentials, so different binaries rather than one with a `--buyer` flag. If only `CROSSLY_PAT` is set, this CLI says so and points you at the other one instead of failing with an opaque 403.

## Commands

```
profile    get
orders     list
cashback   list
cart       get  add  remove  quote
wishlists  list  items  create  add
activity   report  list  preferences
offers     make
```

Every command takes `--help`, and **`--help` never touches the network or needs a token** — it works on a plane.

```bash
crossly-buyer offers make --help
crossly-buyer offers make --listingSlug vintage-levis-501 --amountCents 4500
```

## Nothing here spends money

`cart quote` prices a basket. `offers make` proposes a number. No command completes a purchase — paying happens on Crossly, with you present.

## For scripts and agents

`--json` on everything, byte-faithful to what the API returned. `--ndjson` on lists, one object per line. `--dry-run` prints what would be sent and sends nothing.

Exit codes distinguish **remedies**, which is the point:

| code | meaning | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | ok | |
| `1` | the API said no, or the network failed | read the message |
| `2` | you typed something wrong | nothing was sent |
| `4` | not authenticated | `crossly-buyer login` |
| `5` | authenticated, but missing a scope | re-consent — **not** re-login |

Code `5` exists because "your token expired" and "you were never granted `buyer:cashback:read`" need different fixes, and a wrapper that collapses them will guess wrong on the scope case.

## Money renders as money

Columns ending in `Cents` are formatted as `$45.00` in table output. `--json` leaves the raw integer alone — a script piping to `jq` is the second-biggest consumer of this tool, and reshaping "helpfully" breaks it silently.

## Auth

```bash
crossly-buyer login --token crossly_oat_...   # stored 0600 at ~/.crossly/buyer-auth.json
crossly-buyer whoami
crossly-buyer logout
```

`CROSSLY_BUYER_TOKEN` in the environment takes precedence, so CI needs no file and a shell can override a stale token without logging out.

Stored separately from the seller CLI's `~/.crossly/auth.json` on purpose — sharing one file would mean `crossly login` and `crossly-buyer login` silently overwrite each other.

A seller PAT is refused **at login**, not at first use. Storing it would make every later command fail with an unrelated-looking 403.
